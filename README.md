# Spring Boot Projects

A curated collection of Spring Boot projects I've built while exploring different aspects of the framework - from microservices to security, REST APIs, and full-stack integrations.

## Purpose
This repository serves as my hands-on Spring Boot lab, where I experiment with:
- REST API design
- Microservices communication
- Security implementation
- Full-stack integration
- Protobuf + gRPC configs
- CI/CD with Docker

## Tech Staack
- Java 17+
- Spring Boot 3+
- Docker
- Maven
